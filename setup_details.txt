# cow_sheep_head.pt is weights of model.


Now you're all set to test cow_sheep_head detection model

a) for testing model on an img run command

python detect.py --weights 'path of weights' --source 'path of image'

b) for testing model on multiple images present inside a folder

python detect.py --weights 'path of weights' --source 'folder_path'

c) for testing model on any video, you tube video, rtsp stream

python detect.py --weights 'path of weights' --source   'path of video'  # video
                            				'https://youtu.be/Zgi9g1ksQHc'  # YouTube
                            				'rtsp://example.com/media.mp4'  # RTSP, RTMP, HTTP stream

replace 'path of weights' and 'path of image'

for example, you want to test model on single image and its path in your local directory is 'content/1.jpg' and 
path of weights is 'cow_sheep_head.pt', so you need to run command 

python detect.py --source content/1.jpg --weights cow_sheep_head.pt
